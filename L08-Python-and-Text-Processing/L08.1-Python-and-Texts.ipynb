    "Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters. Most ordinary characters, like 'A', 'a', or '0', are the simplest regular expressions; they simply match themselves. You can concatenate ordinary characters, so last matches the string 'last'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some characters, like '|' or '(', are special. **Special characters** either stand for classes of ordinary characters, or affect how the regular expressions around them are interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `[]`: Used to indicate a set of characters. In a set: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Characters can be listed individually, e.g. [amk] will match 'a', 'm', or 'k'.\n",
    "    - Ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-', for example [a-z] will match any lowercase ASCII letter, [0-5][0-9] will match all the two-digits numbers from 00 to 59, and [0-9A-Fa-f] will match any hexadecimal digit. If - is escaped (e.g. [a\\-z]) or if it’s placed as the first or last character (e.g. [a-]), it will match a literal '-'.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- `(...)`: Matches whatever regular expression is inside the parentheses, and indicates the start and end of a group; the contents of a group can be retrieved after a match has been performed, and can be matched later in the string with the `\\number` special sequence, described below. To match the literals '(' or ')', use \\( or \\), or enclose them inside a character class: [(] [)].\n",
    "\n",
    "- '`|'`: A|B, where A and B can be arbitrary REs, creates a regular expression that will match either A or B. An arbitrary number of REs can be separated by the '|' in this way. This can be used inside groups (see below) as well. As the target string is scanned, REs separated by '|' are tried from left to right. When one pattern completely matches, that branch is accepted. This means that once A matches, B will not be tested further, even if it would produce a longer overall match. In other words, the '|' operator is never greedy. To match a literal '|', use \\|, or enclose it inside a character class, as in [|].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The special sequences consist of '\\' and a character from the list below. If the ordinary character is not on the list, then the resulting RE will match the second character. For example, \\$ matches the character '$'\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\\d`: Matches any decimal digit; this is equivalent to the class `[0-9]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\\D`: Matches any non-digit character; this is equivalent to the class `[^0-9]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\\s`: Matches any whitespace character; this is equivalent to the class `[ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\\S`: Matches any non-whitespace character; this is equivalent to the class `[^ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v]`.\n",

    "- `\\w`: Matches any alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the class `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\\W`: Matches any non-alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the class `[^a-zA-Z0-9_]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These sequences can be included inside a character class. For example, `[\\s,.]` is a character class that will match any whitespace character, or ',' or '.'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final metacharacter in this section is .. It matches anything except a newline character, and there’s an alternate mode (re.DOTALL) where it will match even a newline. '.' is often used where you want to match “any character”.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
